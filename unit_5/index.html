		<h2>Beautifully made, whimsically fun clothing and accessories for your Little Elephant.</h2>
		<p>A Little Elephant has been curated with the mindset that our Earth needs to be protected and that we need to teach our children the importance of living an ecofriendly life. Everything you find on our site has been made with conscious thought in mind.</p>
		<a href="#" class="cta">Learn about ethically sourced clothing</a>
		<!--<p>At A Little Elephant conscious children's boutique we want children’s expressive and adorable personalities to show through their everyday clothes but we also want to teach them the importance of valuing the world around them. The apparel industry is the second dirtiest industry in the world next to oil. Apparel creattion and consumption affects our drinking water, clean air, landfills, chemical emissions and so much more. Making impactful purchasing decisions effects more than just how we are presented to our peers. It can affect the cleanliness of our oceans, endangered wildlife, drinking water…quality of life.</p>-->

		<h2>Why elephants?</h2>
		<p>Elephants are spiritual animals. They represent strength, power, wisdom, leadership, sociability, nature and loyalty. But much like the world we live in they are at risk of extinction. Elephants are beautiful peaceful animals that in their everyday life give back to our eco system.</p>
