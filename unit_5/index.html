	<main><article id="article_one"><p>At A Little Elephant conscious children's boutique we want children’s expressive and adorable personalities to show through their everyday clothes but we also want to teach them the importance of valuing the world around them. The apparel industry is the second dirtiest industry in the world next to oil. Apparel creattion and consumption affects our drinking water, clean air, landfills, chemical emissions and so much more. Making impactful purchasing decisions effects more than just how we are presented to our peers. It can affect the cleanliness of our oceans, endangered wildlife, drinking water…quality of life.</p> </article>
	<article id="article_two"><p>Why elephants? Elephants are spiritual animals. They represent strength, power, wisdom, leadership, sociability, nature and loyalty. But much like the world we live in they are at risk of extinction. Elephants are beautiful peaceful animals that in their everyday life give back to our eco system.</p></article>
