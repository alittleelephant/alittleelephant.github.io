		<h2>Why elephants?</h2>
		<p>Elephants are spiritual animals. They represent strength, power, wisdom, leadership, sociability, nature and loyalty. But much like the world we live in they are at risk of extinction. Elephants are beautiful peaceful animals that in their everyday life give back to our eco system.</p>
